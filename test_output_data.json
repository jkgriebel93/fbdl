            "bio": "Born into a football family in American Samoa, Francis Mauigoa has traveled a winding path to become one of college football's most dominant offensive linemen. Starting his high school journey at San Bernardino's Aquinas before leading Tafuna High to an undefeated season in his hometown of Pago Pago, Mauigoa eventually landed at powerhouse IMG Academy. There, the consensus five-star recruit developed into the nation's top-ranked offensive tackle prospect, drawing offers from virtually every blue-blood program before choosing Miami over Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio State among numerous others.\n\nThe 6'6\", 315-pound behemoth wasted no time making his mark in Coral Gables, starting all 13 games at right tackle as a true freshman while earning Freshman All-America honors and All-ACC Honorable Mention. His sophomore campaign showcased significant development, reducing his sacks allowed from five to just one while cutting his penalties nearly in half. Mauigoa anchored an offensive line that created the nation's most explosive attack, helping Miami lead the country in both points per game (43.9) and yards per game (537.2) while earning second-team All-ACC recognition.\n\nMauigoa's remarkable physical tools have been evident since day one, with Coach Mario Cristobal noting he possesses \"the most muscle density of any athlete we've had here at the University of Miami.\" Despite his massive frame, Mauigoa has been clocked at speeds approaching 20 mph, with a reported body fat percentage hovering around 20% - astonishing numbers that landed him at #5 overall on Bruce Feldman's 2024 prestigious \"Freaks List\" as just a sophomore. His blend of raw power, explosive athleticism, and technical growth has firmly established him as one of the premier offensive tackle prospects in the nation",
            "strengths": [
                "Freakish athletic profile with rare movement skills - can hit the second level with surprising quickness while maintaining balance and body control throughout contact.",
                "Violent hands that deliver shock on initial punch, consistently stunning defenders and creating immediate leverage in pass protection sequences.",
                "Exceptional anchor strength against bull rushers, routinely absorbing power without surrendering ground even against elite defensive linemen.",
                "Natural knee bender who plays with consistent leverage despite his height, showing fluid hip mobility to maintain power position through entire blocks.",
                "Devastating drive blocker with the explosive leg drive to create significant vertical movement, consistently displacing defenders and collapsing entire sides of defensive fronts.",
                "Shows natural mirror ability in pass protection, adjusting to counter moves with crisp footwork that belies his massive frame.",
                "Plays with controlled aggression and genuine nasty streak, finishing blocks with defenders on the ground and visibly imposing his will throughout games.",
                "Demonstrated significant technical growth between freshman and sophomore seasons, particularly in hand placement and pass protection consistency.",
                "Made the 2025 Feldman freaks list - he wrote:\"The 6-6, 335-pounder clocked a 1.57 flying 10-yard split.",
                "His power output registered almost 10,000 watts, which is by far the most on the team, almost 1,000 watts more than the next player.",
                "Last year, Mauigoa measured at 9,274 watts.",
                "His max velocity is 18 mph and his vertical jump is 30 1/2 inches. \"."
            ],
            "weaknesses": [
                "Can occasionally get overaggressive in pass sets, lunging forward and compromising his base against sophisticated rush counters with multiple moves.",
                "Hand placement still shows inconsistency - will sometimes land outside defender's frame, creating vulnerability to being shed in extended reps.",
                "Processing speed against complex blitz packages remains a work in progress, particularly when identifying late loopers or delayed rushers.",
                "Will sometimes rely too heavily on physical dominance rather than technique, which could be exploited by technically refined NFL edge rushers.",
                "Needs more consistency maintaining blocks through completion, occasionally losing contact before whistle against elusive defenders."
            ],
            "summary": "Mauigoa has legitimate franchise tackle potential with the physical tools and developmental trajectory that should have teams in the top five picks salivating. The improvement curve from his freshman to sophomore campaigns suggests a player still scratching the surface of his capabilities, with the ideal blend of athleticism and power to develop into a perennial Pro Bowl caliber tackle. The technical refinement he's shown under Mario Cristobal's tutelage indicates a coachable prospect who responds well to development.\n\nHis immediate impact will be felt most significantly in the run game, where his ability to create vertical displacement can transform a team's ground attack overnight. While still developing the nuances of pass protection, he's already shown the movement skills and anchor strength to handle NFL-caliber edge rushers. Teams employing outside zone concepts will particularly covet his rare ability to reach and seal defensive ends while having the power to execute gap scheme concepts with equal effectiveness.\n\nMiami's offensive system has prepared Mauigoa well for the NFL transition, asking him to execute a diverse array of blocking techniques in both pass protection and run schemes. Given his athletic ceiling, technical growth trajectory, and positional value, Mauigoa projects as a day-one starting right tackle with the potential to develop into an elite blindside protector. Teams like Jacksonville, Carolina, or Tennessee picking in the early first round should view him as a cornerstone piece around which to build their offensive line for the next decade.",
